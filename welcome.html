			<h1>Welcome to the Community</h1>
			<p>This website contains information about research into cigarette advertisements, especially <a href="citations.html#jackler-ayoub-2018">research into medical journals</a>.</p>
			<p>An <a href="citations.html#jackler-li-cardiff-ramamurthi-2019">independent investigation</a> was conducted on Facebook policies regarding cigarette ads. While Facebook did try to prevent dishonest advertising, it was not successful. Ads for hookah tobaccos, e-cigarettes, smokeless cigarettes, and cigars were found. All of these types had some ads which lacked age-gating, including 90% of leading cigarette brands.</p>
