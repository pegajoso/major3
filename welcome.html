				This website contains information about my research into cigarette advertisements, especially <a href="citations.html#jackler-ayoub-2018">research into medical journals</a>.

				An <a href="citations.html#jackler-li-cardiff-ramamurthi-2019">independent investigation</a> was conducted on Facebook policies regarding cigarette ads. While Facebook did try to prevent dishonest advertising, it was not successful. Ads for hookah tobaccos, <a href="glossary.html#e-cigarette">e-cigarettes</a>, <a href="glossary.html#smokeless">smokeless tobacco</a>, and cigars were found. All of these types had some ads which lacked <a href="glossary.html#age-gate">age-gating</a>, including 90% of leading cigarette brands.
