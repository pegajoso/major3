			<h1>Ads</h1>
            <p>
				In order to source resources, I wanted a curated archive that would contain cigarette advertisements. I first tried <a href="https://archive.org/">The Internet Archive</a>. While it contained a lot of desired media, it was not curated. The archive contains everything submitted by users, even in the sections specifically for vintage advertisements. After some Googling, my research led me to <a href="https://www.vintageadbrowser.com/">Vintage Ad Browser</a>. It contains many sections, <a href="https://www.vintageadbrowser.com/tobacco-ads">Cigarettes & Tobacco</a>. There is a whole section dedicated to <a href="https://www.vintageadbrowser.com/joe-camel-ads">Joe Camel</a>, perhaps the most well-known cigarette mascot of all time. My research would also lead me to <i>Celebrities</i> on the same site.
				My main concern when looking for unethical advertising with cigarettes is who was advertised to, such as children, and who was doing the advertising, such as celebrities. When looking for celebrity advertising, the main offender was Philip Morris, which had many advertisements with people in the film and movie instruy. There were many [ads featuring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz], who were famous for their show I love Lucy. While researching this I was surprised to hear that they advertised cigarettes in between shows on the TV. I was so surprised because today it would not be acceptable for a celebrity to advertise in this way. This is especially because I Love Lucy was an all-ages program. I had a problem with advertising that wasn't distanced enough from children, so I wanted to see if there were any other problems. The Vintage Ads website contains a tab for cigarettes, but also a separate tab for Joe Camel. I knew that this was related to cigarettes so I wanted to check out why it would be on its own. Joe Camel is a mascot of a camel made by the Camel cigarette company. The is shown to [wear leather jackets and wear sunglasses] and is shown with trends that were popular with the youth at the time. It earned its own section in the archive because there were so many advertisements. Many of these advertisements were shown in magazines. The Joe Camel ads were clearly meant to target youths.

			<h1>Boxes</h1>
			<p>In addition to how the advertisements were, I wanted to check how on the product. Modern cigarette boxes contain health warnings on them. [This Marlboro box] warns of smoking while pregnant. But cigarette companies only put these on their boxes because it is legally necessary. What did the companies do or were they highly regulated? [This] is a Marlboro box dated from 1924. While the visual elements such as material and wear-and-tear are obvious, there is something more substantially different. This box does not contain any health warnings. In fact, they had not even started filtering their cigarettes at this time.</p>
			<h1>Medical</h1>
			<p>Many of my Academic journals discussed cigarette advertisements related to medical arguments.Â  I hoped that Vintage Ad Browser would also have these so that I could see a representative sample which is independent from all of those. [This ad] has Henry Fonda claiming to use Camels because of no throat irritation. The ad makes a claim that there has not been a single case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels.</p>
