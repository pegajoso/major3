			The article "‘Addressed to you not as a smoker… but as a doctor’: doctor-targeted cigarette advertisements in JAMA" investigates tobacco advertisements in [JAMA] and the [New York State Medical Journal] from 1936 to 1953. Of the 519 advertisements investigated, 84% were by just [Philip Morris] and [Camel]. Jackler and Ayoub conclude that tobacco companies tried to reduce the amount of doctors talking about tobacco's health risks.
			The authors declare no interests. The main rhetorical appeal of the article is *logos*, meaning an argument based on logic. Much of the article is compiling and analyzing data. Data is collected into 13 brands, 33 brand slogans, and 14 advertising tactics. The article is authored by [Robert K. Jackler MD] and [Noel F. Ayoub BS], who have wrote on many medical topics in peer-reviewed journals.

			This article by Jackler, Li, Cardiff, and Ramamurthi goes through Facebook's policies regarding tobacco products has been unsuccessful. The article uses a database of 388 tobacco brands. 78% of hookah tobacco ads 62% of e-cigarette ads and 21% of cigar ads did not include [age-gating], which is required for tobacco advertising.
			<h1><a href="citations.html#jackler-samji-2012">Jackler & Samji (2012)</a></h1>
			Jackler’s first academic article was also about the tobacco industry. It is good to look into. The article is about how tobacco companies payed off otolaryngologists (surgeons of the head and neck) to advertise that smoking was safe. Jackler and Samji base their findings off of internal documents from the tobacco industry that were discovered during litigations.

			This goes into the specifics of one of the slogans investigated in (Jackler et al. 2011). Camel’s most memorable slogan was “More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette,” sometimes together claiming that it was from independent research organizations doing nationwide surveys from every branch of medicine. The article investigates how all of these “independent” surveys were conducted by [RJ Reynolds]’s advertising agency, which would provide complimentary cartons of Camels.
			<h1><a href="citations.html#papaleontiou-agaku-filippidis-2020">Papaleontiou, Agaku, & Filippidis (2019)</a></h1>
			The study tracked data of 17,711 youths in the USA in 2015. 64.4% experienced traditional cigarette advertising, and 38.7% experienced e-cigarette advertising. The study showed that an increase in advertising is associated with higher use of [tobacco] and [nicotine] products. I chose this article because it was unique in that it studied specifically youths. It is important to target specific demographics to get a whole picture of the data. I found this article because it is widely cited, which means that it's more likely that will be reliable. The article focuses on <a href="glossary.html#e-cigarette">e-cigarettes</a>, which is more modern than many other sources are able to talk about. Traditional advertising targets adolescents, as it will get onto tobacco younger.
